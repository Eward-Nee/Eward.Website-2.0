            <p>
                I am Eward van Niekerk. I am a man who wants to work hard.
                I don't like laziness, and I don't like imperfections.
                I like coding and challenges. I am currently learning to
                code by watching Brocode's videos. I also downloaded some
                textbooks to work through when I am done with his videos.
                Currently, I am watching his 4-hour video about HTML and CSS.
                After that video, I will watch his JavaScript video.
                When I learn how to link a database to my code, I will add a
                comment section to my website for any feedback and tips on improving
                my website and also improving my skills. I want to open my own
                business to help people in need of a great-looking website to get one.
            </p>

            <p>

                I will provide a link to the source code files on GitHub in my footer.
                I will appreciate any advice on my GitHub page.
